                            It’s holiday season again. What have you got planned? Some quality time with your family and loved ones? A little last-minute shopping at the mall? A blazing fire and Netflix with the covers draped over your lap like Kumail Nanjiani and his cat?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But what about your content? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seriously. Did you at least get it a stocking stuffer? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’re guessing you didn’t.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that’s ok.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But not really.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your content does so much for you every day on your social platforms, websites, email campaigns, etc. Your content has wishes and dreams for the holiday season too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And you got it nothing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it may be too late to order anything for your content from Amazon, here’s a short list of things you can do to make it happy and prosperous in the new year.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>
                            1. Write for Readers 
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Wouldn’t it be fun to read a story about Jason Derulo eating oatmeal for breakfast while he checked his inbox in a pair of baggy Gap jeans?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Actually, it wouldn’t. Not even for Santa, who they say reads everything.
                        <p>
                            There is just no audience for Jason Derulo eating oatmeal <em>sans penis pants</em>, even in an alternate universe. If “Jason Derulo Eats Oatmeal Bulge-Free” ever did exist as a story, the universe would simply explode. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Probably the greatest gift you can give your content in the coming year is to put more thought into writing for your readers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What do people want to read? Usually articles that satisfy their curiosity, make them laugh, or show them something new, unexpected or useful. Preferably all five at once.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s easy to get side-tracked, we know. If you ever do wander from the path, just ask yourself one question: If I were reading this article, or post or email, I’m writing, what would I want to find there to keep me reading and actually interact with it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you do this, your content will be happy in this universe and all the others. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            2. Give Fewer Stats, More Story
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Do you remember the kid in your eleventh grade English class who was always trying to show you how much more he knew than the teacher? The kid who had a statistic, opinion, or fact about everything? Your content doesn’t want to be that kid. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’re not saying that stats backlinked to reputable sources aren’t useful. They give you and your website more clout, for sure, and they give your curious, more scholarly readers a very easy way to verify the authenticity of what you’ve written.
                        </p>
                        <div class="pull-quote">
                            <h2>
                                “What do people want to read? Usually articles that satisfy their curiosity, make them laugh or show them something new, unexpected, or useful. Preferably all five at once.”
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            But your articles aren’t Christmas trees that serve as “stat” holders. Pumping up your paragraphs with statistics that don’t build your stories — statistics that have appeared in five hundred other places already — will deflate your writing pretty quickly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So focus on your narrative and use stats to add some spice to your arguments. Your content will be so much happier if you do.
                        </p>    
        
                        <h2>
                            3. Don’t Rehash
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Rehashing other writers’ content is the surest way to show your content you don’t care. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did you actually find the Peloton Christmas ad creepy and offensive? Or are you just telling us what they said at the Verge or HuffPost to get some hate clicks? 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            You might get those clicks when Peloton hating is hot. But when the anger cools, you’re still the writer who said nothing new. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Which is why, when we were totally creeped out and offended by the Peloton ad, we chose to start a <a href="https://medium.com/copy-cat/the-real-story-behind-the-peloton-ad-fail-158ebabe6c32">new conversation</a> and approach the ad messaging from a fresh angle: storytelling.  
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            We can’t say for sure, but we believe our content appreciated that. 
                        </p> 
        
                        <h2>
                            4. Say It Your Way
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            German suburbs are so clean and tidy, and they seem to go on forever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Really, I think if you ever wanted to drive a person mad in an hour, you’d just show them a YouTube loop of a cute German street. Like Nyan Cat. But with Beethoven playing in the background. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            We’re not saying we like unkempt, litter-strewn streets no two of which are the same (not naming names, beloved Nicosia). But our minds are fueled by variation. Especially our reading minds. We get bored reading voices that all sound alike.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            So give your content the gift of an original voice. Without it, your content, and the brands, companies, and people you write for, will feel like every other piece of content on the block.
                        </p> 
                        <h2>
                            5. Fire Up Photoshop
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I once had a girlfriend who only fed her cat fresh meals she’d prepared herself. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did the cat have a healthier glow, whiter teeth, and a generally more pleasant disposition? I suspect so. What I know for a fact is that on the one occasion I did the shopping, and brought back a box of Whiskas, the difference was apparent. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            If her healthy, homemade cat food was a fresh loaf of organic sourdough bread, Whiskas was week-old Sunbeam white.
                        </p>
                        <div class="pull-quote">
                            <h2>
                                “Our minds are fueled by variation. Especially our reading minds. We get bored reading voices that all sound alike.”
                            </h2>
                        </div>  
                        <p>
                            All of this is to say, if you want your original, audience-friendly, stat-lean content to have a healthy glow and a winning smile, don’t stick a ready-made photo from Unsplash on top of it. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Beyond the sheer cheese factor — and the fact that you’re subsidizing photo factories like Unsplash (Whiskas), Shutterstock (Fussie Cat), and Getty (Sheba) — there’s a serious disconnect when you publish an original story with a stock visual. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            This obviously opens up a huge can of design and budget worms. However, the fact remains: well-cared-for content thrives on a diet of thoughtful, custom-made visuals, much like John Travolta’s shiny, round pate thrives on a healthy diet of original, thought-provoking weaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On that note, we wish you and your content our warmest holiday wishes and a fantastic new year of joyous, original, passionate writing.
